I built the app using the material given on the course. It was pretty ready,
so I decided to write everything manually. The code in the material worked,
but the page didn't look well. I made it full screen and dynamically adjusting to
window size as well as did some styling.
The routing was new for me and I didn't know that it was possible in react. Although
I've done some projects to learn it by myself (if interested check my github: https://github.com/dmitry-nazarov22).

I learned routing and all in all it wasn't that hard. I can't say I had that big of a challenge
doing this exercise.

One thing to note is that I used NavLink instead of Link because of its built-in
active status that is very helpful at indicating the active tab in the app.
